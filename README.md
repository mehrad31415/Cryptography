# Cryptography
This is the final project (assignment) of the cryptography course by UC San Diego & HSE on coursera. In this project we will implement an RSA system and will model some simple attacks. Note that OTP (One Time Pad) is not included in this project. However, applying OTP should be rather easy as it just requires doing XOR with the message(s), cipher-text(s), and key. 

All the necessary explanations are in the file. Note these functions and the approach are much different from the ones in the course.
